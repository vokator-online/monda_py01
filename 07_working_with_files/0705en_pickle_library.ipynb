    "# Pickle Library for Object Serialization\n",
    "\n",
    "Python provides the `pickle` library as part of its standard library, which is used for object serialization and deserialization. Serialization is the process of converting objects into a byte stream, allowing them to be stored on disk or transmitted over a network. Deserialization is the reverse process of converting a byte stream back into an object.\n",
