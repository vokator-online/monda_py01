    "\n",
    "FOR loop in the Python programming language is a control flow statement that allows you to iterate over a set of elements, such as lists, dictionaries, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "Iteration is a general term used in the fields of programming and computer science, which refers to a process of repeatedly performing a set of instructions or actions on a sequence of elements, typically one element at a time. It's a fundamental concept in programming and is used to traverse, process, or manipulate collections of data.\n",
    "\n",
    "A for loop specifies a variable (or variables) that stores the iteration element for each step. The loop block writes with offset from the left side and is executed for each iteration step of the set.\n"
