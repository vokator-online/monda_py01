    "### What is a `While loop`?\n",
    "A while loop in Python is like constantly asking is some condition is `True` ? If it is, do something `while` it's `True`. For example: \n",
    "-while glass is not full, pour water into glass, if it is full stop pouring water.\n",
    "-while phone battery is less than 100%, charge phone.\n",
    "-while counter is less than 100, add +1 to counter.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Do We Use `While loop`?\n",
    "For iterating until a condition is met, you can use a while loop to do something some number of times, or until some condition is met.\n",
    "For implementing user input, while loops often used to create interactive programs, that reapeatedly ask the user for input.\n",
    "For counting and accmulating, you might use a while loop to calculate the sum of numbers until a certain threshold is reached.\n"
